## Dance Skeleton

This repository has been forked from [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/InMyFeelings_Challenge).It has been modified to create pose estimation skeleton from video stored on the desktop.</br>
webM pose detection skelton video can be downloaded.</br>
It uses captureStream method and MediaStream Recording API to capture canvas and record media.</br>

## Demo

PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.

This is a Pure Javascript implementation of [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet). Thank you [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org) for your flexible and intuitive APIs.
